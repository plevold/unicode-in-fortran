= Unicode in Fortran

== Introduction

WARNING:: The following examples are based on my own experiences and testing.
    I'm neither a Unicode expert nor a compiler maintainer.
    If you find anything wrong with the examples please open an
    https://github.com/plevold/unicode-in-fortran/issues[issue].

Using Unicode characters in you programs is not necessarily hard.
There is however very little information about Fortran and Unicode available.
This repository is a collection of examples and some explanations on how
to use Unicode in Fortran.

Most of what is written here is based on recommendations from
the http://utf8everywhere.org/[UTF-8 Everywhere Manifesto].
I would highly recommend that you read that as well to get a better understanding
of what Unicode is and is not.

== Compilers

The examples used here have been verified to work on the following compiler/OS
combinations:

|===
| Compiler | Version | Operating System | Status
| gfortran | 9.3.0   | Linux            | ‚úÖ
|          | 10.3.0  | Windows 10       | ‚úÖ
| ifort    | 2021.5.0| Linux            | ‚úÖ
|===

== Creating and Printing Unicode Strings

First, make sure that

* Your terminal emulator is set to UTF-8.
* Your source file encoding is set to UTF-8.

With the notable exception of Windows CMD and PowerShell, UTF-8 is probably the default
encoding in your terminal.
If you're using Windows CMD or PowerShell you need to use a modern terminal emulator
like https://github.com/microsoft/terminal[Windows Terminal] and follow the instructions
https://akr.am/blog/posts/using-utf-8-in-the-windows-terminal[here].
If that's too much hassle you can consider switching to
https://gitforwindows.org/[Git for Windows] instead which will give you a nice Bash
terminal on Windows.

With that in place insert unicode characters directly into a string literal in your
source code.
If you're using Visual Studio Code there's an https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=brunnerh.insert-unicode[extension]
that can help you with inserting Unicode characters in your source files.
Using escape sequences like `\u1F525` requires setting special compiler flags and
different compilers seems to handle this somewhat differently.
Unless you know for sure that you want to stick with one compiler forever I would
not recommend doing this.

If you're storing it in a variable, use the default character kind _or_ `c_char`
form `iso_c_binding`.
*Do not* try to use e.g. `selected_char_kind('ISO_10646')` to create "wide" (longer than one byte)
characters.
For one thing, Intel Fortran does as of this writing not support this.
Also if you're going to pass character arguments to procedures you'll either have to do
conversion between the default and the `ISO_10646` character kinds or you need to
have two versions of each procedure that might need to accept both wide and default
character kinds.
As we will later see, this is never really needed so you will only create extra work
for yourself.

*Example:*
[source,fortran]
----
include::../example/write_to_console.f90[]
----

This should output

[source]
----
‚ùØ fpm run --example write_to_console
 Fortran is üí™, üòé, üî•!
----

As we can see from in output from the example above the emojis are printed like we
inserted them in the source file.


== Determining the Length of a Unicode String

Some might be confused by that

[source,fortran]
----
include::../example/unicode_len.f90[]
----

outputs

[source]
----
‚ùØ fpm run --example unicode_len
          28
----

while if we manually count the number of character we see in the string literal
then we end up 19 character.
This is because in Unicode what we perceive as one character might consist of
multiple bytes.
This is referred to as a _grapheme cluster_ and is crucial when rendering text.
Determining the number of grapheme clusters and their width when rendered on the
screen is a complex task which we will not go into here.
For more information see the http://utf8everywhere.org/#characters[UTF-8 Everywhere Manifesto]
and https://hsivonen.fi/string-length/[It's Not Wrong that "ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è".length == 7].

We're mainly concerned about storing the characters in memory though, as our
terminal emulator or text editor takes care of displaying the results on our screen.
For this it is useful to think of the character variable as a sequence of bytes
rather than a sequence of what we perceive as one character.
When `len(chars) == 28` that means that we need 28 elements in our variable to
store the string.

== Searching for Substrings

Substrings can be searched for using the regular `index` intrinsic just like
strings with just ASCII characters:

[source,fortran]
----
include::../example/unicode_index.f90[]
----

outputs

[source]
----
‚ùØ fpm run --example unicode_index
          14 n
          18 ¬π
----

There is no need for any special handling thanks to the design of Unicode:

[quote,'http://utf8everywhere.org/#textops[UTF-8 Everywhere Manifesto]']
Also, you can search for a non-ASCII, UTF-8 encoded substring in a UTF-8 string as if it was a plain byte array‚Äîthere is no need to mind code point boundaries. This is thanks to another design feature of UTF-8 ‚Äî a leading byte of an encoded code point can never hold value corresponding to one of trailing bytes of any other code point.

Keep in mind though that what looks like a single character (a grapheme cluster)
might be more than one byte long so `chars(i:i)` will not necessarily output the
complete match.

== Reading and Writing to File

Reading and writing Unicode characters from and to a file is as easy as writing ASCII text:

[source,fortran]
----
include::../example/file_io.f90[]
----

The `open` statement in Fortran allows to one to specify `encoding='UTF-8'`.
In testing with `ifort` and `gfortran` however this does not seem to have any
impact on the file written.
Specifying `encoding` does for example not seem to add a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark[Byte Order Mark (BOM)] neither
with `gfortran` nor `ifort`.

== Conclusion

We've seen that using Unicode characters in Fortran is actually not that hard!
One need to remember that what we perceive as a character is not necessarily
a single element in our character variables.
Apart from that using Unicode characters in Fortran should really be quite
straight forward.
